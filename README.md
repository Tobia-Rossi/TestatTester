## Test the testat exercise to see how many points you should get.
## Expects flake8 to be installed to check for PEP8 compliancy.
## Place the file in the same folder as the testat_vorname_nachname.py file, start it using python and input your testat_vorname_nachname.py making vorname and nachname the same as your file.
## This programm only tests full methods and gives you 0 points if any part of the method is not implemented correctly even if one of the single Txxx should have given you points.
